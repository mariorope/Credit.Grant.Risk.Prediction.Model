**Title:** *Credit Grant Risk Prediction Model: Enhancing Financial Decision Making with Machine Learning*

**Introduction:**
<div align="justified">This project demonstrates the creation of a machine learning model designed to predict whether financial institutions should offer credit to new clients. It acts as a crucial resource for financial decision-makers who aim to reduce risks and enhance lending strategies. The project was completed using the RStudio IDE, which is based on the R language, along with several essential packages needed to carry out all tasks. These tasks included data munging, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, and the development and evaluation of machine learning models. Various algorithms and predictors were tested to identify the most accurate models.</div>

**Background:**
<div align="justified">This project was completed as a component of my "Big Data Analytics with R and Azure Machine Learning" coursework at the Data Science Academy [I'm an inline-style link](www.datascienceacademy.com.br). It provided a chance to implement newly acquired skills and knowledge in real-world situations. Although instructors offered a solution to the existing problem, my goal was to enhance and innovate on these methodologies by utilising advanced data manipulation techniques and model selection strategies.</div>

**Objective:**
<div align="justified">The main goal of this project was to create an enhanced credit risk prediction model specifically designed for the needs of financial institutions. I aimed to boost the accuracy and dependability of the predictive model through thorough data munging, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. I explored key algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes to determine the most effective method.</div>

**Problem Statement:**
<div align="justified">Financial institutions require a predictive model to inform their decision-making process regarding credit issuance to new clients. By leveraging historical data, this model aims to provide actionable insights that facilitate prudent lending decisions while minimising risks.</div>

**Data:**
<div align="justified">The project utilizes a CSV dataset located within the same repository. While variable names are self-explanatory, detailed documentation regarding variable categories is not provided. This absence does not impede the analysis process. Additionally, the project includes an attached R script, "fun_utils.R," containing essential functions utilised throughout the project.</div>

**Conclusion:**
<div align="justified">Through the development of this Credit Grant Risk Prediction Project, I have demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques in addressing real-world challenges faced by financial institutions and have refined a predictive model for credit grant risk achieving an accuracy of 88.7%, with a precision of 87.7% and recall of 85.5%.</div>
