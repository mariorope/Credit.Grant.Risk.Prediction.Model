# Credit Grant Risk Prediction Model
This project presents the development of a machine learning model to predict if a financial institution should grant or not credit to new clients.

This project was part of my studies in the course “Big Data Analytics with R and Azure Machine Learning” at Data Science Academy (www.datascienceacademy.com.br), and another solution for this problem was also provided by the instructors. My motivation to do this work was to practice all the new knowledge and skills acquired (R language) during my training, including data munging, exploratory analysis, data visualization, feature selection, creation and evaluation of machine learning models. The main purpose of this project was to improve the previous versions of the model and find my own solution for this problem, using different data manipulation techniques and three algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes.

Problem definition: Financial institutions want a predictive model to support their decision on providing credit grants or not to new clients based on their historical data.

Data: A csv file used to run this project is provided in the same folder as this project. The variable names are self-explanatory, however there is no dictionary for the categories of all variables, as it was not supplied and do not interfere in this analysis. Moreover, it is also available an attached R script, named fun_utils.R, which is necessary as it holds a few functions used in this project.
